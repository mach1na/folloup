## ~~Defer the ghosting flush to idle instead of firing mid-interaction~~ — resolved

The SSD1677 driver used to force a full-waveform refresh inline the moment
the 8th consecutive partial refresh was requested (`kMaxPartialRefreshesBeforeFlush`
in `components/epaper_panel/ssd1677_driver.cpp`), so arrowing through more
than 8 items in a menu/timeline triggered a full, flashy refresh
mid-navigation.

Split into a soft budget and a hard ceiling:
- `EpaperPanel::NeedsGhostingFlush()` turns true once the soft budget (still
  8) is reached, but no longer forces anything by itself.
- `display_service::DisplayTask` polls its command queue with a short timeout
  (`kGhostingFlushIdleMs`, 500ms) once a flush is pending; a gap that long
  with no new command means input has paused, and that's when the deferred
  full refresh (`RefreshCurrentScreenLocked(RefreshMode::kFull)`) actually
  runs — invisible to active navigation.
- `kHardPartialRefreshCeiling` (2.5x the soft budget, 20) still forces the
  flush inline in `RefreshPartialFullScreen` if input never pauses long
  enough, so ghosting can't grow unbounded under continuous input.

Verified on-device: idle-deferral fired during a real pause after 8 partials
(full-refresh signature: `reset≈50ms`/`init≈9.9ms` vs `0`/`0` for a partial),
and the hard ceiling fired inline during a sustained run where presses never
left a 500ms gap.

Also fixed as a drive-by: the stale comment on `kMaxPartialRefreshesBeforeFlush`
claiming "the flush is now on the fast waveform" (it isn't — reverted in
`ae15b27` back to the slow mode-1 waveform since the fast OTP waveform
settled at visibly lower contrast).

## ~~Display sleep never actually blanks the panel~~ — resolved, docs corrected

Investigated: `docs/auto-sleep.md` used to document the display-sleep
sequence as refresh-to-blank -> wait -> sleep. The actual code
(`SleepPanelLocked` in `components/display_service/display_service.cpp`) only
ever repaints the status-bar sleep indicator (the little leaf icon) before
calling `panel.Sleep()` — it never blanks the page content, so the panel
freezes on its last screen and powers down in that state.

Craig confirmed this is the preferred behavior, not a bug: a frozen screen
signals "powered down but holding state" more usefully than a blank one,
which is indistinguishable from off/broken, and it avoids spending an extra
refresh cycle against the panel's ghosting budget
(`kMaxPartialRefreshesBeforeFlush`). Docs updated to describe this as
intentional instead of a spec the code fails to meet — no code change needed.

## Battery usage investigation

Look at overall battery efficiency and see where we can improve it —
covers active draw (audio codec kept on for its lifetime per
`docs/app-architecture.md`, Wi-Fi, display refresh frequency) and sleep-path
draw (light sleep / display sleep via `device_sleep_service` +
`main/device_sleep_runtime.cpp`, AXP2101 rail behavior). No investigation
done yet — needs profiling before deciding what (if anything) to change.

## Reorder footer icons for usability

The bottom footer icon order isn't intuitive — revisit the order to make it
more user-friendly. Needs a proposed new order (from Craig or from usage
patterns) before implementing; footer rendering lives in `epaper_ui`.

## ~~Tone down the summarize/vibe-check prompts~~ — resolved

Found two spots with a "chummy" tone:

- `summary_service::BuildSummaryInstructionText` (`components/summary_service/summary_service.cpp`):
  the final (non-intermediate) notes/todos prompts told Gemini to write in an
  "encouraging and optimistic tone" that's "motivating to look back on" /
  "celebrates progress" — dropped in favor of "concise and factual."
  Intermediate/rollup prompts were already factual and untouched.
- `vibe_check_page_coordinator.cpp`: the Vibe Check page's static UI copy
  (`kMessageText`, `kEmptyStateMessage`) had the same overly-cute tone
  ("Some thoughts are passing vibes... what still hits", "Get the ball
  rolling!") — reworded to plain, neutral copy.

## Offline transcription queue doesn't actually work

Auto-retry for offline-recorded notes was added in commit `3366004`
("Auto-retry transcription for notes recorded offline") but it's not working
end-to-end:

- No badge/indicator showing how many notes/todos are still untranscribed.
- No automatic retry trigger when Wi-Fi reconnects — needs to actually kick
  off transcription for queued items on network-back, not just be able to
  retry if something else triggers it.

Needs investigation into why the existing auto-retry logic isn't firing
before deciding on a fix.
